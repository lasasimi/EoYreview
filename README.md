# EoYreview
This is a project to capture how my 2021 went through daily and weekly journaling.
The daily focus is on feelings or emotions and the weekly focus is on things I learned and am grateful for.

The blogpost is in this link: <a href="https://lasasimi.com/2021/12/31/__trashed/">2021 End of Year Review with R</a>

I learned mostly from <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html">Tidy Text Mining with R</a> especially to create n-grams and network analysis for the visualization.
