# EoYreview
This is a project to capture how my 2021 went through daily and weekly journaling.
The daily focus is on feelings or emotions and the weekly focus is on things I learned and am grateful for.

The blogpost is in this link: <a href="https://lasasimi.com/2021/12/31/__trashed/">2021 End of Year Review with R</a>

I learned mostly from <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/ngrams.html">Tidy Text Mining with R</a> especially to create n-grams and network analysis for the visualization and benefitted greatly from <a href="https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/">googlesheets4</a> to import my journaling data from Google Sheets to R.

Uncommon packages that I use are:
- `googlesheets4`
- `tidytext`
- `igraph`
- `ggraph`

I'm still a newbie in R and intend to learn more to become better. If you have any suggestions or comments regarding this project, feel free to let me know through:<br>
